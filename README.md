  ## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset contains responses from a telecom company's customers across various cities in India.
- **Size**: 1,039 observations and 35 variables.
- **Variables**: Includes demographic data, monthly charges, total revenue, and customer churn details.
## Objectives
- To identify factors influencing customer tenure.
- To build and validate a predictive model using financial and demographic data.
- To provide actionable insights to enhance customer retention.
## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data cleaning, visualization, and summary statistics.
- **Statistical Tests**:
  - Parametric: Two-sample t-tests, ANOVA.
  - Non-parametric: Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis.
- **Regression Modeling**:
  - Multiple Linear Regression.
  - Variable Selection: Best Subset, Forward selection and Backward Elimination.
 ## Key Results
- Strong positive correlations between tenure and variables like `Total Charges` and `Total Revenue`.
- Significant differences in customer tenure based on offers, contracts, and device protection plans.
- Regression model with high predictive accuracy using selected variables.
## Technologies Used
